# Recipe Popularity Prediction

## Background  
Tasty Bytes, an online recipe startup, features new recipes daily on their homepage. Popular recipes can boost site traffic by up to 40%, but predicting which recipes will become popular beforehand is challenging. Recipes are labeled popular based on a high engagement score.

## Overview  
This project aims to predict recipe popularity using machine learning, focusing on identifying unpopular recipes with at least 75% accuracy to help the startup optimize featured content. The approach includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and comparing models to maximize precision.

## Key Highlights  
- **Data Processing**: Addressed missing values and encoded categorical variables.  
- **EDA**: Analyzed trends and variable relationships.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Created relevant features to boost model performance.  
- **Modeling**: Evaluated two models for precision:  
  - Logistic Regression: **0.8977**  
  - Random Forest: **0.7925**  

## Purpose  
The notebook is structured to showcase end-to-end data science skills, not for reuse by beginners.

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Data wrangling  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Feature engineering  
- Model development  
- Performance evaluation
