# Recipe Popularity Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes and predicts the popularity of recipes based on various features. The focus is on showcasing data science skills, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning modeling.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Processing:** Handling missing values, feature transformations, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying key trends and relationships in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Modeling:** Training and evaluating machine learning models to predict recipe popularity.
- **Insights & Interpretation:** Presenting findings to extract meaningful business insights.

## Purpose
This notebook is structured to demonstrate expertise in data science workflows rather than being a fully runnable, beginner-friendly guide. It emphasizes skills over reusability.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling & preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model development
- Performance evaluation & insights generation
