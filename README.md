# Recipe Popularity Prediction

## Overview
This project explores the factors that drive recipe popularity on a website and aims to build a model that predicts whether a recipe will attract high or low traffic. The goal is to achieve at least **80% precision** in predicting recipe popularity while uncovering actionable insights to **boost website engagement and subscriptions**.
The focus is on showcasing data science skills, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning modeling.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Processing:** Handling missing values, feature transformations, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying key trends and relationships in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Modeling:** Training and evaluating machine learning models to predict recipe popularity.
- **Insights & Interpretation:** Presenting findings to extract meaningful business insights.

## Purpose
This notebook is structured to demonstrate expertise in data science workflows rather than being a fully runnable, beginner-friendly guide. It emphasizes skills over reusability.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling & preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning model development
- Performance evaluation & insights generation
